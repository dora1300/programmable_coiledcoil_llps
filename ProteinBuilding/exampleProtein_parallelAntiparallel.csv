# Example design file for building a CC protein
# Description of the file format and how to use this is provided in the proteinBuilding_README.md
# Design files MUST be .CSV. There are 7 columns that hold information about coil segments, and 3 columns that hold information about linker segments. The columns are:
# Segment type , start index of segment (1-index) , end index of segment (1-index) , start index of first 'a' heptad position, type of multimer, special ID for multimer
# See the below design file for making a 4-coil-3-linker protein with dimer-forming coils, alternating orientation, and each orientation-type of coil has the same ID to help enforce proper interaction,,,,
